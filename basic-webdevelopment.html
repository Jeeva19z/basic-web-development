    <h2>Web Development Basics</h2>
    <p>Web development refers to the process of building and maintaining websites or web applications. It involves various aspects such as web design, web content development, client-side/server-side scripting, network security configuration, and more.</p>
    <p><strong>HTML (HyperText Markup Language):</strong> HTML is the standard markup language for creating web pages. It defines the structure of content on a web page using elements like headings, paragraphs, links, images, etc.</p>
    <p><strong>CSS (Cascading Style Sheets):</strong> CSS is used to style the HTML elements, controlling their layout, appearance, and presentation. It allows you to define styles such as colors, fonts, margins, and positioning.</p>
    <p><strong>JavaScript:</strong> JavaScript is a programming language that enables interactive and dynamic functionality on web pages. It can be used for tasks such as form validation, creating animations, handling user interactions, and making AJAX requests.</p>
    <p><strong>Client-side vs. Server-side scripting:</strong> Client-side scripting refers to scripts executed on the user's browser, while server-side scripting refers to scripts executed on the web server. JavaScript is a common client-side scripting language, while server-side languages include PHP, Python, Ruby, Java, and more.</p>
    <p><strong>Web Servers:</strong> Web servers are software applications that deliver web content to users based on their requests. Apache, Nginx, and Microsoft IIS are popular web server software.</p>
    <p><strong>Database Management Systems (DBMS):</strong> Many web applications store data in databases. Common database management systems include MySQL, PostgreSQL, MongoDB, and SQLite.</p>
    <p><strong>Frameworks and Libraries:</strong> Web development frameworks and libraries provide pre-written, reusable code to streamline the development process. Examples include React, Angular, Vue.js for front-end development, and Django, Ruby on Rails, Laravel for back-end development.</p>
    <p><strong>Responsive Web Design:</strong> With the proliferation of various devices with different screen sizes, responsive web design ensures that websites adapt and display properly on all devices, including desktops, tablets, and smartphones.</p>
    <p><strong>Web Security:</strong> Web developers need to be aware of security best practices to protect websites from common vulnerabilities such as cross-site scripting (XSS), SQL injection, and CSRF (Cross-Site Request Forgery).</p>
    <p><strong>Version Control Systems:</strong> Version control systems like Git are essential tools for managing and tracking changes to web development projects, facilitating collaboration among developers and enabling rollbacks to previous versions if needed.</p>
    <p>These are just some basic concepts in web development, and the field is constantly evolving with new technologies and best practices emerging regularly.</p>
